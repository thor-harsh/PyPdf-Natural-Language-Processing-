**In this project We will use PyPdf2 with Python to do an amazing stuff.Here we will work how PyPdf2 library works for working with pdf files in Natural Language Processing.** <br></br>


**Before jumping to the code lets understand PDF files and PyPDF2 library and NLP(Natural Language Processing) First**...<br></br>

**What is PDF and PyPDF2?** <br></br>

PDF stands for Portable Document Format, is distinguished by its .pdf file extension. This format is predominantly utilized for document sharing due to its inherent property of preserving the original formatting, ensuring that documents appear consistent across various platforms, irrespective of the hardware, software, or operating system used. This consistency makes PDFs the format of choice for distributing, viewing, and ensuring the integrity of documents on a global scale.

Originally developed by Adobe, PDF has transcended its proprietary origins to become an open standard, governed by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO). This transition to an ISO standard has further cemented PDF‚Äôs position as a cornerstone of digital document management, facilitating its adoption in a wide range of applications from academic publishing to business communications


**What is (NLP)Natural Language Processing**?<br></br>

NLP or Natural language processing is an interdisciplinary subfield of computer science and linguistics. It is primarily concerned with giving computers the ability to support and manipulate human language.<br></br>

NLP combines computational linguistics‚Äîrule-based modeling of human language‚Äîwith statistical, machine learning, and deep learning models. Together, these technologies enable computers to process human language in the form of text or voice data and to ‚Äòunderstand‚Äô its full meaning, complete with the speaker or writer‚Äôs intent and sentiment.<br></br>

NLP drives computer programs that translate text from one language to another, respond to spoken commands, and summarize large volumes of text rapidly‚Äîeven in real time. There‚Äôs a good chance you‚Äôve interacted with NLP in the form of voice-operated GPS systems, digital assistants, speech-to-text dictation software, customer service chatbots, and other consumer conveniences. But NLP also plays a growing role in enterprise solutions that help streamline business operations, increase employee productivity, and simplify mission-critical business processes.<br></br>
